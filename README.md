### Description

This repository contains software and results for experiments as part of the forthcoming Dashing2 paper, demonstrating the [Dashing2](https://github.com/dnbaker/dashing2) software tool.

This includes JI Range experiments in the `jirange` folder, exhaustive all-pairs benchmarking (`allpairs/exhaustive`), and K-Nearest Neighbor graph accuracy and speed (`allpairs/thresholded`).
